# AGENTS.md

This file is the authoritative reference for working on
**macos-tahoe-liquid-kde**. Mirrors at `CLAUDE.md`, `CODEX.md`, and
`GEMINI.md` point back here so each agent finds the same content under
the filename it expects.

## Project Overview

> Disclaimer: This project is not affiliated with KDE, the KDE e.V.
> organization, or Apple Inc. It is an independent, community-driven
> theme set that gives KDE Plasma 6 a macOS Tahoe-inspired look. It
> must never pretend to be an official KDE or Apple product.

macos-tahoe-liquid-kde is an installer + theme pack that turns a stock
KDE Plasma 6 desktop into a macOS Tahoe lookalike: top menu bar, Dock,
Aurorae window decorations, Plasma + Kvantum + GTK + icon themes,
Acrylic Glass KWin effect, light/dark global theme with timed
switching, wallpapers, fonts, cursors, and a Plymouth boot splash.

**Target platforms.** systemd-based KDE Plasma 6.6+ distros only. The
container matrix covers Arch, CachyOS, Manjaro, EndeavourOS, Garuda,
Gentoo, Fedora, Nobara, and openSUSE Tumbleweed. Immutable rpm-ostree
distros (Silverblue, Kinoite) are explicitly out of scope: the
installer writes into `/usr/lib*` and `/usr/share`, which are
read-only on those systems and need either an rpm/Flatpak-extension
wrapper or an rpm-ostree layering path that this project does not
maintain. There is no non-systemd path (no Artix, no Devuan, no Void)
and no non-KDE path.

**Distribution target:** GitHub releases + AUR.
**License:** GPL-2.0-or-later for forked components, original code as
marked in the repo.
**Stack:** Python 3.11+ installer dispatching into per-feature steps;
QML plasmoids; C++ Qt6 plasmoids (Global Menu, Dock Task Manager) and
a KWin effect (Acrylic Glass) compiled at install time against the
host's Qt6 / KDE Frameworks 6.

## Naming Convention

- **PascalCase** for theme names: `MacTahoeLiquidKde-Dark`,
  `MacTahoeLiquidKde-Light`.
- **kebab-case** for IDs: `org.kde.mac-tahoe-liquid-kde.<component>`.
- Plasmoid suffixes are simple nouns: `.menu`, `.launcher`, `.trashcan`
  — not compound words like `.kpplemenu`.
- The user-facing CLI binary is `mac-tahoe-theme-switch`. Repo entry
  points are `./install` and `./uninstall` (no `.sh` extension).

## Branding

- No external author references in metadata, configs, or QML headers
  — the user maintains attribution separately.
- Mirror files keep source URLs (functional, not attribution).
- README **Credits** section is managed manually by the user.
- Do NOT add "fork of X" or "based on Y" to README descriptions —
  use "inspired by" wording.
- Do NOT reference Pear OS.

## macOS Terminology

| KDE default        | Project uses     |
| ------------------ | ---------------- |
| Recent Applications| Suggestions      |
| Applications       | Apps             |
| Show more          | Show All         |

Menu plasmoid entries: About This Computer, System Settings, App
Store, Force Quit, Sleep, Restart, Shut Down, Lock Screen, Log Out.

## UI/UX Conventions

- Menu plasmoid dropdown items use icons (matches the macOS Tahoe
  Apple menu).
- Hover tiles: glass effect (semi-transparent fill, 0.5px micro
  border, 22px radius) — not outlined borders.
- System font always — never hardcode font names or sizes.
- Popup plasmoids are fixed-size, not resizable.
- Top panel is applets-only floating (not full-floating).
- Category switcher must support both mouse drag and wheel scroll.

## Repository Layout

| Path                          | Contents |
| ----------------------------- | -------- |
| `install` / `uninstall`       | Thin shell wrappers that exec `src/scripts/cli.py`. Both require sudo. |
| `VERSION`                     | Single-line semver string read by `paths.read_version()`. |
| `features.json`               | Per-feature enable flags, written by `--only` / `--no-*` and read on the next run. |
| `src/scripts/`                | Installer Python. **Flat layout — no `installer/` subdir.** |
| `src/scripts/cli.py`          | Entry point. Parses flags, runs preflight, dispatches steps. |
| `src/scripts/preflight.py`    | 9-check fail-fast probe (sudo, paths, Qt6, Plasma, kwriteconfig6, DBus, kded6, disk, plasmoid IDs). |
| `src/scripts/distro.py`       | The ONLY module that knows per-distro paths and package manager commands. |
| `src/scripts/paths.py`        | Repo-relative paths only. Never shells out, never reads /etc/os-release. |
| `src/scripts/step_runner.py`  | Imports and runs per-phase functions on each step module. |
| `src/scripts/utils.py`        | `run_user`, `kw_write`, `kw_read`, `have`, `fetch`, `pkg_install`, `auto_dep`, `qdbus_call`. |
| `src/scripts/theme_switch.py` | `mac-tahoe-theme-switch` implementation. Installed as a console script. |
| `src/scripts/state.py`        | `RunTracker` — records last-run summary for `./install --status`. |
| `src/scripts/log.py`          | `banner`, `step`, `ok`, `warn`, `info`, `note`, `fail` — single source of UI styling. |
| `src/scripts/steps/`          | One module per feature. Implements `deps`, `download`, `build`, `install`, `uninstall`, `restart_plasma` as needed. |
| `src/scripts/steps/_helpers.py` | `sudo_install_file`, `sudo_install_tree`, `sudo_remove`, `_as_root` context manager. |
| `src/offline/`                | All assets bundled in the repo: plasmoids, plasma theme, kwin-effects, aurorae, color-schemes, gtk, kvantum, look-and-feel, layouts, plymouth, nautilus, wallpapers, plus the systemd unit + timer. |
| `src/offline/wallpapers/<id>/`| One folder per wallpaper, JPEG q90 + `metadata.json` (3840×2160 minimum). Fully offline — no `download()` phase. |
| `tests/`                      | pytest suite. `./test` is the runner. |
| `tests/containers/`           | One Dockerfile per supported distro + `run_in_container.py` + `run_matrix.sh`. |
| `tests/vm/`                   | Plymouth render-capture harness (output gitignored). |

## Step Module Contract

Each module under `src/scripts/steps/` implements any of these
functions; missing ones are skipped:

| Phase            | When run                                  | Purpose |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------- |
| `deps()`         | Before any other phase, install-time only | Return list of `cmd:pkg` tokens; the runner resolves them via `distro.package_for()` and `auto_dep()` installs missing ones. |
| `download()`     | After deps                                | Network fetches. Most steps have none (assets are bundled). |
| `build()`        | After download                            | Compile C++ (Global Menu, Task Manager, Acrylic Glass effect). |
| `install()`      | Main pass                                 | Copy files, write configs, register kwin/plasma settings. |
| `uninstall()`    | `./uninstall` run                         | Remove installed files; clean legacy `/usr/lib/qt6` artefacts. |
| `restart_plasma()` | Final pass of `./install`               | The one allowed plasmashell restart per session. |

Output convention inside `install()`:

1. Per-item `ok()` / `reinstall()` lines first.
2. Then any "Foo set to / applied" status lines.
3. The `info()` summary count is always the LAST line of the step.

## Architecture — Sudo Policy

Both `./install` and `./uninstall` require sudo. The compiled C++
plasmoids and the Acrylic Glass KWin effect land under the system Qt6
libdir (the dir `qmake6` reports — never hardcoded), because Qt6
doesn't walk `~/.local/lib/qt6` in a default Plasma session.

- The sudo precondition is checked in Python via `os.geteuid()`. If
  not root, `cli.py` exits immediately with the canonical
  `Re-run as: sudo ./install` line. The outer shell handles the actual
  sudo prompt so we sidestep the `pam_unix conversation failed`
  cascade that bricks terminals where sudo can't read the password
  (VSCode integrated, tmux+OSC133, sandboxes that pollute the TTY).
- After the euid check passes, the CLI drops effective UID to
  `SUDO_USER` via `os.setegid(SUDO_GID); os.seteuid(SUDO_UID)`. Files
  written from then on land with normal user ownership.
- The `sudo_install_file` / `sudo_install_tree` / `sudo_remove`
  helpers in `steps/_helpers.py` re-elevate via the `_as_root()`
  context manager (`seteuid(0)`) for the one operation that needs
  root, then drop back. Real UID stays at 0 the whole time so the
  trip back to root is always permitted.

## Architecture — Distro Detection Layer

`src/scripts/distro.py` is the ONLY file allowed to know per-distro
paths or package manager commands. Steps and preflight must never
hardcode `/usr/lib/qt6`, `pacman -S`, `dnf install`, etc.

| Function                              | Returns |
| ------------------------------------- | ------- |
| `current_distro()`                    | Lowercase `/etc/os-release` ID (`arch`, `cachyos`, `gentoo`, `fedora`, `opensuse-tumbleweed`, ...). |
| `distro_id_like()`                    | ID_LIKE chain so downstream distros (Nobara → fedora, Garuda → arch) inherit the parent's package map. |
| `qt6_plugins_dir()` / `qt6_qml_dir()` | Asks `qmake6` → `qtpaths6` → `pkg-config Qt6Core` in that order. Falls back to the per-distro libdir table only when that dir actually exists on disk. Otherwise raises `Qt6PathsMissing` with the distro-appropriate install hint. |
| `package_for(token)`                  | Translates an Arch package name from a step's `deps()` token into the equivalent on the current distro (`g++:gcc` → `gcc-c++` on Fedora, `sys-devel/gcc` on Gentoo). |
| `package_manager_install_cmd()`       | Non-interactive install prefix for the current distro. |

Static guards in `tests/test_static.py`:

- `test_no_hardcoded_qt6_libdir` rejects any executable line outside
  `distro.py` / `paths.py` that mentions `/usr/lib/qt6` or
  `/usr/lib64/qt6`.
- `test_no_hardcoded_package_manager_outside_distro_layer` rejects
  `pacman -S` / `dnf install` / etc. anywhere else.

Don't fight these — add a row to `distro.py` instead.

## Architecture — Preflight

`src/scripts/preflight.py` runs before any step touches disk. Nine
checks, fail-fast:

1. **Sudo escalation hop.** Real UID 0, effective dropped to user, the
   round-trip back to root works.
2. **Destination paths inside allowed roots.** No step would write
   outside `$HOME` or the system Qt6 libdir.
3. **Qt6 plugin search agrees with where we'd write.**
4. **Plasma 6.6+.** Compiled plasmoids link against 6.6 headers.
5. **`kwriteconfig6` + `kreadconfig6` on PATH.**
6. **DBus session bus reachable** (env var or
   `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/bus` socket).
7. **kded6 running** (soft — warn but don't block).
8. **Disk space** (50 MB on the Qt6 libdir partition, 100 MB on
   `$HOME`).
9. **Plasmoid ID consistency** (skipped on uninstall).

Anything that calls Qt6 binaries from preflight MUST go through
`utils.run_user`. It sets `preexec_fn=drop_privs_in_child` so the fork
has matching real / effective / saved UIDs. Qt6 binaries refuse to
run when `getuid() != geteuid()` with `FATAL: The application binary
appears to be running setuid`. Never reach for `subprocess.run`
directly from preflight — `test_plasma_version_drops_privs_in_child`
is the guard against that regression returning.

## Architecture — Live Theme Switching

`mac-tahoe-theme-switch {light|dark|auto}` is the single entry point.
The same binary runs:

- inline at the end of `./install`,
- from the post-login systemd user service (`After=plasma-plasmashell.service`),
- from the 06:00 / 18:00 systemd user timer,
- by the user manually.

`./install` writes both the service and the timer (under
`~/.config/systemd/user/`) and enables them.

Light/dark switching applies:

1. Look-and-feel package (`plasma-apply-lookandfeel -a <pkg> --keep-auto`).
2. Plasma theme, color scheme, icon theme, cursor theme, Kvantum
   theme, Aurorae window decoration, GTK theme, wallpaper.
3. The Kvantum widget-style cycle (see below).

**Kvantum cycle.** Kvantum is a Qt style plugin and cannot reload its
kvconfig in a running app — only `QApplication::setStyle()`
re-instantiates the plugin. Confirmed upstream:
<https://github.com/tsujan/Kvantum/discussions/975>.
`cycle_widget_style_live(target)` writes `widgetStyle=Breeze`,
broadcasts `KGlobalSettings.notifyChange` + the xdg-portal
`SettingChanged` signal, then writes the target back and broadcasts
again. Run the cycle AFTER `apply_extras()` so `kvantummanager --set`
has rewritten the kvconfig; otherwise Kvantum re-instantiates against
the old config and the menu visuals stay stale.

**Look-and-feel retry schedule.** `_apply_lookandfeel_live` waits 2s
before the first attempt (DBus name registration race after
`After=plasma-plasmashell.service` clears), then 6s between retries.
Worst case: 2 + 6 + 6 = 14s of sleeps. Don't shorten the 2s lead-in
— `plasma-apply-lookandfeel` exits 0 against a not-yet-ready bus
without actually re-rendering.

## Architecture — Wallpapers

Wallpapers are fully bundled. Every entry under
`src/offline/wallpapers/<id>/` is a JPEG q90 (re-encoded from 6K PNG
originals) plus `metadata.json`. Total bundled is ~50 MB.

PNG / JPEG re-compression with zip / xz / zstd was tested empirically
and saves 0% (the bytes are already entropy-coded). JPEG q90 is the
only viable size reduction.

`steps/wallpapers.py` has no `download()` phase. The static test
`test_repo_ships_full_macos_wallpaper_set` enforces that every name in
`_FIXED_NAMES` ships a `3840x2160` (or larger) image with a metadata
file. Don't add a network-fetch fallback.

## Architecture — Dependency Guards

Every step that uses an external tool checks the tool exists before
invoking it and surfaces a `warn()` when it doesn't:

| Step                    | Guard |
| ----------------------- | ----- |
| `plymouth.py`           | `_grub_is_active_bootloader()` requires BOTH `/etc/default/grub` AND a regen binary (`grub-mkconfig` or `grub2-mkconfig`) on PATH. A leftover `/etc/default/grub` on a systemd-boot user is NOT a signal to patch GRUB. |
| `kvantum.py`, `window_decorations.py`, `plasma_theme.py` | `kw_write()` returns are checked; failure emits an explicit `warn()` mentioning `kwriteconfig6`. |
| `fonts.py`              | `fc-cache` is guarded by `have("fc-cache")`. Missing fontconfig is a warn, not a fail — fonts still copy and appear after re-login. |
| `acrylic_glass.py`      | Build deps probed via `auto_dep()` before invoking cmake/make. |

`tests/test_step_guards.py` covers the kwriteconfig6 missing path and
the fc-cache missing path; `tests/test_plymouth_step.py` covers the
bootloader probe.

## Architecture — Container CI Matrix

| File                         | Role |
| ---------------------------- | ---- |
| `tests/containers/Dockerfile.<distro>` | One per supported distro. CachyOS pulls both `archlinux-keyring` and `cachyos-keyring` after `pacman-key --init && pacman-key --populate archlinux cachyos`. |
| `tests/containers/Dockerfile.gentoo-base` | Builds the GHCR base image `ghcr.io/lestercorderomurillo/mttkde-gentoo-base` so qtbase doesn't compile from source on every PR. |
| `tests/containers/run_in_container.py` | Per-distro probe: qmake6 resolves, the distro layer agrees with what qmake6 reports, every `package_for()` token resolves in the distro's repo (with a "transient network" skip so flaky upstream CDN edges don't tank CI), preflight destination checks, pytest. |
| `tests/containers/run_matrix.sh` | Local runner. CI runs the same workflow via `.github/workflows/test.yml`. |

When a probe fails, the script scans stderr for transient-network
markers (`"Failed to retrieve"`, `"Could not resolve host"`, repo
metadata errors) and emits `SKIP` instead of `FAIL`. Anything else is
a genuine missing package and fails CI.

## File Map — Steps

| Module                        | Responsibility |
| ----------------------------- | -------------- |
| `acrylic_glass.py`            | Compile and install the Acrylic Glass KWin effect (.so + QML + metadata to the system Qt6 libdir). |
| `apply.py`                    | Wraps `mac-tahoe-theme-switch` invocation from inside `install`. |
| `apps.py`                     | Misc app config tweaks (dolphin, konsole, etc.). |
| `color_schemes.py`            | Installs `MacTahoeLiquidKde-{Light,Dark}.colors` under `~/.local/share/color-schemes/`. |
| `cursors.py`                  | Cursor theme install. |
| `fonts.py`                    | SF Pro / SF Mono → `~/.local/share/fonts/`, `fc-cache` if available. |
| `globalmenu.py`               | Build + install the Global Menu C++ plasmoid. |
| `global_theme.py`             | Plasma look-and-feel package (`MacTahoeLiquidKde-{Light,Dark}`). |
| `gtk.py`                      | GTK 2/3/4 theme. |
| `icons.py`                    | macOS-style icon set. |
| `kvantum.py`                  | Kvantum Qt widget style. |
| `layout.py`                   | Top panel + dock layout. May be retried once after `restart_plasma` if the first pass raced plasmashell's plugin discovery. |
| `nautilus.py`                 | Nautilus integration (file manager set as default on KDE for users who prefer it). |
| `plasma_theme.py`             | Translucent panels and dock SVGs. |
| `plasmoids.py`                | QML plasmoids: Menu, Launcher, Trashcan, IconTasks. |
| `plymouth.py`                 | Boot splash. GRUB patch behind `_grub_is_active_bootloader()`; `--no-grub-modify` opt-out exists. |
| `portals.py`                  | Route xdg-portal FileChooser / AppChooser to KDE (fixes stale dialog colors). |
| `sddm.py`                     | Login screen theme. |
| `sounds.py`                   | Notification and event sounds. |
| `theme_switch.py` (step)      | Installs the `mac-tahoe-theme-switch` binary, systemd user service, and timer. |
| `wallpapers.py`               | Copies the bundled wallpaper set. No network. |
| `window_decorations.py`       | Aurorae assembly (decoration.svg + rc + button icon SVGs + metadata per theme dir) + kwinrc `org.kde.kdecoration2`. |

## Logging Convention

`src/scripts/log.py` is the single source of UI styling.

- `banner(version)` — rainbow Apple logo + version line, ONCE per
  invocation, at the top.
- `step(n, total, name)` — `Step N/T: Foo...`.
- `ok("...")` — green check, per-item success.
- `reinstall("...")` — yellow arrow, per-item idempotent re-apply.
- `warn("...")` — yellow warning that does NOT abort.
- `note("...")` — neutral context line.
- `info("...")` — summary line. Always LAST in a step.
- `fail("...")` — red error, increments `errors`, may abort.

The rainbow palette is fixed:

```
green   yellow   orange   red   purple   blue
46      226      208      196   165      33   (256-color codes)
```

## Key Conventions

### Threading and subprocesses

- Every Qt6 binary call from inside install / preflight goes through
  `utils.run_user` so the fork's real/effective UIDs match and Qt6's
  setuid guard doesn't abort it.
- `kw_write` and `kw_read` wrap `kwriteconfig6` / `kreadconfig6`. Both
  return a bool; install steps must check it.
- `qdbus_cmd()` returns `qdbus6` when present, falls back to `qdbus`.
- Never restart plasmashell during a `mac-tahoe-theme-switch`
  invocation — only the explicit `restart_plasma` step at the end of
  `install` is allowed to do that.

### Path handling

- `paths.py` is repo-relative only. It must not shell out and must
  not read `/etc/os-release`.
- Everything system-related goes through `distro.py`.
- Step modules import from `paths` for asset locations and from
  `distro` for system-side write targets.

### File writes

- New files always go through `sudo_install_file` /
  `sudo_install_tree`. They re-elevate, copy, drop back. Direct
  `shutil.copy` to a system path will fail because effective UID is
  the user by the time a step runs.
- Removals on uninstall go through `sudo_remove`.

### Config writes

- All kwinrc / kdeglobals / plasmarc writes go through `kw_write`.
- Don't open and rewrite an INI file by hand — `kwriteconfig6`
  preserves comments and case.
- `plasma-apply-lookandfeel` writes into `~/.config/kdedefaults/<file>`.
  When reading, check `kdedefaults/` first before the top-level config
  (`_read_config_cascade` in the verifier).

### kdecoration2

- Window decorations go through kwinrc `org.kde.kdecoration2` group.
- Aurorae theme directory layout per side:
  `decoration.svg` + `rc` + button icon SVGs + `metadata.json`.

## Known Pitfalls

| Issue                                          | Detail |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| Qt6 setuid abort                               | Calling `qmake6` / `qtpaths6` / `kreadconfig6` from a process where `getuid() != geteuid()` aborts with `FATAL: ... appears to be running setuid`. Use `utils.run_user`, never bare `subprocess.run`. |
| Kvantum signal-only refresh                    | Sending `KGlobalSettings.notifyChange(StyleChanged)` alone does NOT reload kvconfig. Use `cycle_widget_style_live()` — Qt apps observe the cycle, not just the signal. |
| `plasma-apply-lookandfeel` against cold bus    | Exits 0 against a not-yet-ready DBus session without actually re-rendering. The 2s lead-in in `_apply_lookandfeel_live` exists for this — don't shorten it. |
| `kdedefaults` cascade                          | The verifier must check `~/.config/kdedefaults/<file>` first, then the top-level config. `plasma-apply-lookandfeel` writes to the kdedefaults copy, so a naive `kreadconfig6 --file kdeglobals --key ColorScheme` returns empty. |
| Legacy `/usr/lib/qt6/.../*.so`                 | Pre-current-release installs wrote compiled plasmoids to `/usr/lib/qt6`. New installs don't, but uninstall has to remove those leftovers to leave the system in a clean Breeze state. That's why `./uninstall` also requires sudo. |
| Stale `/etc/default/grub`                      | A user who switched from GRUB to systemd-boot / Limine / rEFInd may have the file lying around. `GRUB_DEFAULT.is_file()` alone is NOT proof GRUB is active — `_grub_is_active_bootloader()` requires a regen binary on PATH too. |
| Layout race after plasmashell restart          | Applying the panel layout immediately after `plasmashell --replace` sometimes races plasmashell's plugin discovery. `layout.py` is retried once after `restart_plasma`. |
| GHCR Gentoo base                               | Gentoo Dockerfile pulls a pre-built base image. If qtbase changes major version upstream, rebuild the base via the dedicated workflow, NOT in the per-PR matrix run. |
| zip / xz / zstd on JPEG-or-PNG                 | Saves 0%. Don't add a wrapped-archive transport for wallpapers — re-encode to JPEG q90 instead. |
| `plasma-apply-lookandfeel` `--keep-auto`       | Required so the LaF apply doesn't blow away the user's color-scheme follow-the-system preference. |
| `pacman-key` on stale CachyOS images           | Container Dockerfile must run `pacman-key --init && pacman-key --populate archlinux cachyos` before `pacman -Sy archlinux-keyring cachyos-keyring`. |

## Testing

`./test` runs the full pytest suite. Always run it before commit,
merge, and release — see the project's release-flow rules.

Highlights:

- `tests/test_static.py` — no hardcoded Qt6 libdir; no hardcoded
  package manager outside `distro.py`; every wallpaper bundled with
  metadata.
- `tests/test_preflight.py` — all 9 preflight checks; the Qt6
  drop-privs guard regression test.
- `tests/test_step_guards.py` — kwriteconfig6 missing, fc-cache
  missing.
- `tests/test_plymouth_step.py` — bootloader probe, GRUB patch
  preserves quotes.
- `tests/test_theme_switch.py` — Kvantum cycle, LaF retry schedule,
  cascade-aware reads.
- `tests/test_apply_safety.py` — no plasmashell restart from
  `mac-tahoe-theme-switch`.
- `tests/test_cmake.py` — the C++ plasmoids and KWin effect build
  configure cleanly.
- `tests/containers/run_matrix.sh` — full per-distro probe.

## What NOT to Do

- Don't add scaled variants (1.25x, 1.5x) — keep only the base theme.
- Don't use fullscreen `Window` overlays for launchers — use popup
  representations.
- Don't add session / shutdown buttons inside the Launcher — that's
  the Menu plasmoid's job.
- Don't make commits referencing "Kmenu" or "Kpple" — use "Menu" and
  "Launcher".
- Don't bypass the widget-style cycle by trying to send
  `KGlobalSettings.notifyChange(StyleChanged)` alone.
- Don't restart plasmashell during a `mac-tahoe-theme-switch`
  invocation.
- Don't hardcode `/usr/lib/qt6` or call `pacman -S` / `dnf install`
  outside `distro.py` — static tests will reject it.
- Don't call Qt6 binaries from preflight with bare `subprocess.run`
  — use `utils.run_user`.
- Don't introduce a wallpaper `download()` phase — wallpapers are
  bundled.
- Don't centre tile section headers in README — they're left-aligned
  plain markdown image syntax (`![Alt](url)`), not
  `<p align="center">`.
- Don't add `Co-Authored-By: Claude` (or any AI) trailers to commits.
- Don't `--amend` published commits. Don't `--no-verify` to skip
  hooks. Don't force-push to `main`.
